# Lead Time Driven Delivery Simulation
Lead Time Simulation and Optimisation using Operations Research methods.

 This repo and blog series is under active development, here is the general outline so far:

[Lead Time Driven Delivery - Part 1 - Learning to see](http://www.zankavtaskin.com/2020/01/applied-software-delivery-system.html)

[Lead Time Driven Delivery - Part 2 - Learning from data](http://www.zankavtaskin.com/2020/03/lead-time-driven-delivery-metrics.html)

[Lead Time Driven Delivery - Part 3 - Focus on results, not methods](http://www.zankavtaskin.com/2020/08/lead-time-driven-delivery-focus-on.html)

[Lead Time Driven Delivery - Part 4 - Stabilise through embedded testing](http://www.zankavtaskin.com/2020/09/lead-time-driven-delivery-stabilise-and.html)
