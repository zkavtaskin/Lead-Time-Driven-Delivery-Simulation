# Strengthening your Agile practice by introducing Lead and Cycle Time

## Abstract

## Introduction

Agile methodologies such as Scrum, Extreme Programming and DSDM have emerged in the 1990s and most of them were inspired by the lean manufacturing movement. Majority of the methodologies follow similar values but are delivered in a different way. Unfortunately Agile methodologies are experiencing the following problems:
1. They were inspired by the manufacturing industry, software engineering is not manufacturing as it follows different paradigm. This renders some of the lean techniques not as effective in knowledge work. 
1. Multitude of key performance indicators make it hard to realise what is the "key" indicator further reinforcing entropy. Additionally KPIs usually don't provide any very much needed insight in to what needs to be done to improve operations. This is because focus is on methods and not the results. 
1. As they are so prescriptive new practitioners have to spend a lot of time practicing Agile methods. After a lot of practice they can follow rules and understand what needs to be done, but not why they are doing it. 
1. They value **how** you work (methods) over what gets the results, this makes it very hard to understand what needs to be changed to make methodology work for your particular environment. 
1. They need to integrate with the whole business way beyond Software Engineering, this includes Marketing, Sales, Customer support, etc. Due to difficulty in achieving this, department's choose to keep their improvements to themselves, leading to a local optimisation, meaning organisation as a whole fails to get overall benefits. 
1. Term agile is not well defined, it is hard to understand what is meant when stakeholders say "we have to be more Agile" or "we need to change our process to be more Agile".
1. In time entropy erodes established best practice, making practitioners lose their "true north" bearings. It also makes it really difficult or not even possible to go back to "true north" if stakeholders lose faith in the existing process. 

Above problems have been witnesses by me directly and indirectly across various software engineering departments in the industry. In this article I will explore how above problems can be remedied through introduction of lead and cycle time. 

## Alternative perspective 
In this section I will explore how your existing agile operations can be viewed from a different angle, and why we as practitioners have been experiencing above problems.

### Knowledge work is not manufacturing 

Agile methodologies do borrow ideas from lean manufacturing and engineering. While some ideas such as standards, components, trunk based development, and value streams have been very useful, others such as Kanban, Theory of Constraints (ToC),  Little's Law and One piece flow get applied wrongly. As a practitioner I have immersed myself in these concepts reading "Agile Management for Software Engineering" and "Phoenix Project" and for a while I was under impression that these concepts were working. Only after some reflection it became evident that these ideas did not work as expected, they actually ended up slowing delivery operations which lead towards a lot of frustration. In this section we will explore why exactly ToC, Little's Law and one-piece flow can't be applied literally and need to be considered from an alternative angle.

I am not an expert in manufacturing, so this section's examples should be taken as high level ideas that serve as a contrast to knowledge work.

#### Manufacturing 

Since the rise lean manufacturing majority of companies have transitioned towards one-piece flow. This is where work travels in discrete pieces from station to station where some operation is applied on to it such as:

This means that factory's tend to have one assembly line down which work travels. Takt dictates how much time each station has to complete their task. For example in car manufacturing, you might need to install car dashboard, you will be given 3 minutes per car to do this. If you find an issue, don't have enough time, you can "stop the line" so the entire assembly line stops.

Car manufacturers have been doing this for decades so they have figured out ways to ensure that each station has as few issues as possible so there is very little disruption. As you can imagine work is monotonous, however quality people are needed, so these assembly line workers tend to get paid well (in the UK). 

Assembly lines can get very long and they might have number of inputs before the work gets merged in to a single line. This can be witnessed when car manufacturers perform "marriage", this is when they insert the chassis, transmission and engine in the body on the production line.

Lastly all of the cars are not the same. They will be built per different specifications. Some will have premium interior, different wheels, upgraded electronics and so on. This means each stage needs to know what exactly needs to be done for that particular car. This adds additional complexity to the manufacturing process. 

Now that we know some of the pertinent details we can explore why assembly line work is different to knowledge line work.
