# Strengthening your Agile practice by introducing Lead and Cycle Time

## Abstract

## Introduction

Agile methodologies such as Scrum, Extreme Programming and DSDM have emerged in the 1990s and most of them were inspired by the lean manufacturing movement. Majority of the methodologies follow similar values but are delivered in a different way. Unfortunately Agile methodologies are experiencing the following problems:
1. They were inspired by the manufacturing industry, software engineering is not manufacturing as it follows different paradigm. This renders some of the lean techniques not as effective in knowledge work. 
1. Multitude of key performance indicators make it hard to realise what is the "key" indicator further reinforcing entropy. Additionally KPIs usually don't provide any very much needed insight in to what needs to be done to improve operations. This is because focus is on methods and not the results. 
1. As they are so prescriptive new practitioners have to spend a lot of time practicing Agile methods. After a lot of practice they can follow rules and understand what needs to be done, but not why they are doing it. 
1. They value **how** you work (methods) over what gets the results, this makes it very hard to understand what needs to be changed to make methodology work for your particular environment. 
1. They need to integrate with the whole business way beyond Software Engineering, this includes Marketing, Sales, Customer support, etc. Due to difficulty in achieving this, department's choose to keep their improvements to themselves, leading to a local optimisation, meaning organisation as a whole fails to get overall benefits. 
1. Term agile is not well defined, it is hard to understand what is meant when stakeholders say "we have to be more Agile" or "we need to change our process to be more Agile".
1. In time entropy erodes established best practice, making practitioners lose their "true north" bearings. It also makes it really difficult or not even possible to go back to "true north" if stakeholders lose faith in the existing process. 

Above problems have been witnesses by me directly and indirectly across various software engineering departments in the industry. In this article I will explore how above problems can be remedied through introduction of lead and cycle time. 

## Alternative perspective 
In this section I will explore how your existing agile operations can be viewed from a different angle, and why we as practitioners have been experiencing above problems.

### Knowledge work is not manufacturing 

Agile methodologies do borrow ideas from lean manufacturing and engineering. While some ideas such as standards, components, trunk based development, and value streams have been very useful, others such as Kanban, Theory of Constraints (ToC) and Little's Law creates confusion and false sense of security. As a practitioner I have immersed myself in these concepts reading "Agile Management for Software Engineering" and "Phoenix Project" and for a while I was under impression that these concepts were working. Only after some reflection it became evident that these ideas did not work as expected, they actually ended up harming delivery operations and leading towards a lot of frustration. In this section we will explore why exactly ToC and Little's Law can't be applied literally.
