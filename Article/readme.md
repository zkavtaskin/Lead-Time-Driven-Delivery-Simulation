# Using lead and cycle time to go beyond Agile dogma in software engineering 

## Abstract

## Introduction

Agile methodologies such as Scrum, Extreme Programming and DSDM emerged in the 1990s and most of them were inspired by the lean manufacturing movement. All of the Agile like methodologies are set of best practices that practitioners in the field witnessed. Majority of these methodologies follow similar values but in different flavors. Problems with these methodologies are:
1. They were inspired by the manufacturing industry, software engineering is not manufacturing as it follows completely different paradigm. 
1. They value "how you work" over "what gets the results", this makes it very hard to change methodology to work for your particular environment. 
1. As they are so prescriptive new practitioners have to spend a lot of time practicing Agile rituals and even after years of practice while methods might be understood the "spirit" gets missed.
1. They need to integrate with the whole business way beyond Software Engineering, this includes Marketing, Sales, Customer support, etc. 

In this article author will provide evidence to why these points need to given a serious consideration and how lead time and cycle time can solve these problems. 

At this point it is important to stress that author values certain best practices that have emerged from various Agile methodologies. Additionally it is better to have some framework that has been developed over the years by practitioners collaboratively then by someone randomly on their own while they are in the middle of the project. As such this article does not disregard decades of research and work, but builds upon it by adding to it a very much needed results oriented component that questions the prescribed dogma and allows practitioners to extend their chosen methodology through evidence.  

## Problem analysis
