# Using lead and cycle time to go beyond Agile dogma in software engineering 

## Abstract

## Introduction

Agile methodologies such as Scrum, Extreme Programming and DSDM emerged in the 1990s and most of them were inspired by the lean manufacturing movement. All of the Agile like methodologies are set of best practices that practitioners in the field witnessed. Majority of these methodologies follow similar values but in different flavors. Fundamental problems with these methodologies are:
1. They were inspired by the manufacturing industry, software engineering is not manufacturing as it follows completely different paradigm. 
1. Prescribed best practices are not guaranteed to work for your organization, as these best practices have emerged in a particular environment and culture that most likely will be different to yours. This means that one methodology does not fit all organizations.
1. Prescribed best practices have very little or no scientific evidence behind them. Meaning they are based on empirical evidence at best or anecdotal at worse. 
1. They value "how you work" over "what gets the results", this makes it very hard to amend or change methodology to work for your particular environment. 
1. As they are so prescriptive new practitioners have to spend a lot of time practicing Agile rituals and even after years of practice more often then not core concepts and ideas are still not understood. 
1. Given all of the investment and decades of Agile practice, Agile transformations still fail.

In this article author will provide evidence to why these points need to given a serious consideration and how lead time and cycle time can solve these problems. 

At this point it is important to stress that author values certain best practices that have emerged from various Agile methodologies. Additionally it is better to have some framework that has been developed over the years by practitioners collaboratively then by someone randomly on their own while they are in the middle of the project. As such this article does not disregard decades of research and work, but builds upon it by adding to it a very much needed results oriented component that questions the prescribed dogma and allows practitioners to extend their chosen methodology through evidence.  

## Problem analysis
In this section each problem with Agile will be explored and evidence will be provided.

### One methodology does not fit all organisations
...
### No evidence behind best practices  
...
### Focus on method and not results
...
### Long time to onboard practitioners
...
### Agile transformations failure
